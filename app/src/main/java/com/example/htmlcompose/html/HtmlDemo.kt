   <p>The smart money suggests you're more likely to achieve your goal if it is SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time bound)</p>

   <ol>
      <li>If you're keen to <b>save</b> an <i>emergency</i> fund, for example, start by calculating&nbsp;🤯&nbsp;three months' worth of expenses, work out how long it will take you to save that amount and set up an automatic transfer for the money to go into a rainy day&nbsp;🌧fund each pay.</li>
      <li>Let's dive a little deeper into each one.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Make your savings goals specific</li>

      <li>This is all about breaking it down into bite-sized chunks</li>
      <li>Saving ${'$'}8,000 for a four week trip to Vietnam may seem daunting, but if you calculate how much that is over a week, fortnight or month</li>
